# Ray Tracing in One Weekend - Python Implementation

This project provides a Python implementation of "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", adapted from the original C++ code.

The script uses Python's numpy library for efficient numerical operations and follows an object-oriented programming approach to maintain modularity and reusability.
